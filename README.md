For my first sketch, I decided to create a skiing scene because it is one of, if not my favorite thing to do in the world.  It is really meant for anyone who is interested in skiing or sports at all, but honestly it does not say as much as I would like it to say about skiing overall.  Instead of engendering some emotions and feelings that one experiences while skiing, my first sketch simpley depicts a landscape of a skiing scene.  The colors that I originally selected, blues, whites, and grays, do capture some of the cold, snowy vibes that are associated with skiing, but then I decided to abstract these colors in order to give the viewer some interactive power with my piece.  The juxtaposition of the simple, cool blues and grays, with the vibrant yellows, reds, and blues that I added to the mountains do give a sense of excitement that can be associated with skiing.  However, in my next sketch, I am definitely going to try to expand on the idea of skiing in order to give the veiwer more of a feel of what it is like to be on a mountain.  I will try to engender the exhileration and free feeling one has as they fly down the side of a mountain through fluffy powdery snow.  In order to do this, I plan on abstracting my work further, which is something that I am definitely not very comfortable with at the moment.  I want to portray less of a landscape scene that can immediately be recognized as a ski mountain, but instead portray more of an abstract work that plays off some of the feelings one gets when skiing.  

The three videos that I watched demonstrate three artists and their approach to their art.  One of the artists, Hillary Lloyd, has an interesting take on art, stating that it might not be understandable, but thats okay.  I find this take very interesting and different from any idea that I've had before, and moving forward, I would like to try to incorporate this idea into my work, despite thke fact that my first instinct is not very comfortable with the idea.  I think that throughout this class, I will try to force myself to become more comfortable with abstract art, which will be difficult because I have always been more of a realism artist in my past.  I'm excited to experiment and expand into this new artform and new method of creating art. My work, at the moment, does not match with these artists styles, but I am going to try to become more abstract in my works.
